# Ember-bootstrap-confirm

An [ember-cli][1] add-on which provides Bootstrap's bs-confirm dialog.

This is a minimum viable plugin: it assumes you already have Bootstrap CSS and JS available in your project (e.g. using [ember-bootstrap][2]). Once installed, you can use

    {{bs-confirm noActionText='No' yesActionText='Yes'}}

to get a confirmation dialog with "No" and "Yes" buttons.
