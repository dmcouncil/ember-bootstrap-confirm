* Ember.js v4.8 or above
* Ember CLI v4.8 or above

## Usage

This is a minimum viable plugin: it assumes you already have Bootstrap CSS and JS available in your project (e.g. using [ember-bootstrap][2]). Once installed, you can use

    <BsConfirm @noActionText='No' @yesActionText='Yes' />

to get a confirmation dialog with "No" and "Yes" buttons.
